# rock-paper-scissors
This is a program to play a game of rock paper scissors while getting the input from the player by using the prompt. It uses a random number generator to choose the computer input and compares that input to the player's input. It is currently playable in the developer console, but will have added functionality in the future to be playable using buttons on the webpage.
